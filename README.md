# CISCO-PACKET-TRACER
# Networking Project

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **Cisco Packet Tracer** project focused on **network topology design, device configurations, and real-world simulation of networking scenarios**. The project demonstrates fundamental and advanced networking concepts, making it an excellent learning resource for networking enthusiasts and professionals.

## ✨ Features
- **Complete Network Simulation**: Includes routers, switches, PCs, and servers
- **VLAN Implementation**: Segregation of networks for security and efficiency
- **Routing Protocols**: Configured **OSPF, RIP, EIGRP, and static routing**
- **Network Security Measures**: Implemented **ACLs, port security, and firewalls**
- **Subnetting & IP Addressing**: Properly assigned IPv4/IPv6 addresses
- **DHCP & DNS Services**: Automated IP allocation and domain resolution
- **Real-World Networking Problem-Solving**: Scenarios covering troubleshooting and optimizations

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Download and install from [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/)
- **Basic Networking Knowledge**: Understanding of IP addressing, subnetting, and routing
- **Git Installed**: For cloning the repository

### Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Open **Cisco Packet Tracer** and load the `.pkt` file
3. Experiment with device configurations, test network connectivity, and modify settings as needed

## ⚙️ Network Configuration Examples
Here are some essential network configurations used in the project:

### 📌 Basic Router Configuration
```bash
enable
configure terminal
hostname Router1
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
 exit
```

### 📌 Configuring OSPF Routing
```bash
router ospf 1
 network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
```

### 📌 Setting Up VLANs
```bash
vlan 10
 name Sales
exit
interface FastEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
exit
```

### 📌 Implementing DHCP
```bash
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10
ip dhcp pool LAN_POOL
 network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 192.168.1.1
 dns-server 8.8.8.8
exit
```
